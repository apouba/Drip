# Drip

  For some context, I am a computer science major, with a specialization in human-computer interaction, and a minor in media art and design. This all means that I love the intersection of art and technology and humans and have always been trying to find a space that includes all three that I enjoy. Although I never really thought myself "artistic" when I was younger due to lack of exposure to painting or what not, I always appreciated all that the computer allowed me to do whether that meant play around with design and animations on google slides, or exploring the vast amount of images on the web. Now I realize some of the potential I have with a computer in my hands to bring into existence such variety and mixtures of things and ideas.

  I created this piece with crisp lines and colors at the top of the heart with that all to fade towards the bottom. I wanted to show how much you can still create with the internet and technology even though sometimes it seems as though technology is very clean and organized and that messiness of the real world can become hidden. Not that the heart has to be bleeding so to say, but things can morph and melt and have human characteristics. I think with enough imagination and an open mind, we can recreate what might seem lost in newer ways (they probably need an update anyway). 

I imagine this page expanding downwards with the red heart dripping onto another separate art piece and connecting each piece by some of their unusual chaos.
